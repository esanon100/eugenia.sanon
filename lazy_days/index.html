    <h2> Never Eat At Home Again</h2>
    <h3> By Susan Smith </h3>
    <img src="images/diner.jpg" alt="diner">
  <P> As my New Year's resolution in 2016, I vowed never again to make a meal at home.
    I found that cooking meals at home took time and effort, and the food nevers seemed
    to measure up to the greasy food that is readily available at my old diner. </P>

   <h2> The Art of Doing Absolutely Nothing</h2>
      <h3> By Jose Perez</h3>
      <img src="images/beach.jpg" alt="beach">
      <P> Is you job taking too much time away from your rest and relaxation?
        Does your algebra keep you up at night? I used to be in the same boat until
        I quit work and school and devoted myself to doing absolutely nothing. Many people think
        that laziness is a vice, but I am here to tell you that it is an art. </P>
